# Multiple Tools

Hello fellas, Nice to see you here. Let me explain the whole project.

## Introduction
This is the web app for anyone who is willing to convert their image from JPG to PNG. Or, would like to merge multiple PDFs to make an arranged PDF. Or, before setting up a password for any online services or websites nice to check whether it's leaked before or not. This webapp is a combination of these three functionalities and not storing any type of data. You can upload and play with the app to check or fulfill your needs.

## Deployed Model on Heroku
You can test the model on **Heroku** from this [**link**](http://multiplefunc.herokuapp.com/). It's really nice to use your own tools to convert images and merging multiple PDFs. I have tried to make this website as simple as possible. Below steps will navigate you to use this application.
